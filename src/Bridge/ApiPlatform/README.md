# ApiPlatform Bridge

The ApiPlatform bridge provides integration for [ApiPlatform](https://github.com/api-platform/core/) with the
[AutoMapper bundle](https://github.com/janephp/automapper-bundle).

If you use the AutoMapper bundle, the bridge will be automatically loaded and will ignore any ApiPlatform resources
if you try to normalize/denormalize some of them.
